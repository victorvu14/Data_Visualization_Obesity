# Obesity_Data_Visualization

In this project, we visualize a dataset that contains data related to the level (rate) of adult obesity in the United States from 2011 to 2015.

The objective of the project was to become familiar with creating some standard and more innovative visualizations with ggplot2/R. 

Four main steps were conducted during this assignment: 
1.	Select and save our data
2.  Understand the data
3.  Manipulate and create additional separate datasets
4.  Create charts to represent the dataset
